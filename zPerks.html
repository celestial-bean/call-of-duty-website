              Perks are special attributes you can get by spending points at the perk machines. They cost 2500 points for the first one and increase by 500 points for every next one you get. You can find the perk machines around the map, but some maps have some perks machines, and some have others. That is why there is a machine called the “der wonderfiz machine”. It is a perk machine that has every perk, regardless of the corresponding machine is in that map. It is deactivated until  a  certain round, or when you are in the dark aether.
