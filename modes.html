              Modes are what you play when you play multiplayer.  Every mode has its own objective, or thing you need to do to win. Consequently , they each have their own strategy. Some modes make you earn points to win, and others are best to three or six.  Some modes also have no respawns until the next round or after a timer.
              There are also limited time modes (ltm) that change every the week or on holidays.
            <br /><br />  The list of available modes:<br /> Combined Arms: Assault, Combined Arms: Domination, VIP Escort, Team Deathmatch, Kill Confirmed, Free-for-All, Domination, Hardpoint, Control, Search & Destroy, 2v2 Gunfight,	Prop Hunt, 3v3 Face Off, and Free-for-All.
