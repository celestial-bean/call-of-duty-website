              Weapons in zombies are almost the same as multiplayer but with a few differences. When modifying a weapon in zombies, there are some attachments that are only useful in multiplayer, so they are changed to fit zombies.
            <br /><br />  One major difference is that you can “pack a punch”  a weapon with the pack a punch machine (PAP). The pack a punch machine can be unlocked by doing a short mission and it offers large damage boosts and ammo mods. Ammo mods are elemental effects for your bullets, toxic, freeze, fire, electric, and explosive.
          <br />  <br />  You can also use the arsenal to spend scrap and salvage to upgrade armor and increase your weapons damage . It is unlocked by turning on the power.
